Create a custom class to describe a product (let's say it's a front for an online store). As product properties, you can use the price value, description, weight of the product. Create a couple of instances of your class and test them out.

Describe the Triangle class.<br>
As properties, take the lengths of the sides of the triangle.<br>
Implement a method that will return the area of this triangle.<br>
Create some objects of this class and test them.
</p>

<b> home_work_1_3_OOP </b><br>
Create a class 'Phone' (Phone) one of properties should be its number.<br>
Create a 'Network' class (mobile operator network). The Phone class should describe the following methods:<br>
- Registration in the mobile operator's network;<br>
- A method that implements an outgoing call. This method takes one parameter (describing the mobile phone number). The logic of this method is as follows: if the current phone has not been registered in the network, then terminate the method with a message about it. If the current phone has been registered and the network also has a phone to which the call is being made, then call the incoming call method on that phone. If the phone to which you are making a call is not registered in the network, then terminate the method with a message about it.<br>
- The method that implements the incoming call. It accepts a parameter in the form of a number from which a call was made to the current one. Display a message like a number such and such is calling you.
