<h1> 4. Interfaces </h1>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_1_OOP </b><br>
Extend the implementation of the Students group with the ability to sort the array of students by last name. To do this, add the sortStudentsByLastName() method to the Group class.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_2_OOP </b><br>
Create a separate class that implements reading student characteristics from the keyboard (first name, last name, etc.). Create and return a student based on the read data. Use the methods of this class to read and add a student to a group.
</p>

<p>
<b> home_work_4_3_OOP </b><br>
Declare an interface:<br>
<br>
&ensp;	public interface CSVConverter{<br>
&ensp;&ensp;	public String toCSVString();<br>
&ensp;&ensp;	public Student fromCSVString(String str);<br>
&ensp;	}<br>
<br>	
The Student class must implement this interface. The implementation logic is as follows - based on the Student, create a line with its CSV representation, and vice versa, create a Student based on this line.
</p>

<p>
<b> lesson_4_1_OOP </b><br>
Sorting an array of references of Type Cat.
